# Game-Server-and-Client

General Description:

In this assignment you will implement a text-based game server and client. The communication between the
server and the client(s) will be performed using a simple text based protocol (TBGP), which can potentially
support different games; However, your server will only support a single game - Bluffer.
The implementation of the server will be based on the Reactor and Thread-Per-Client servers taught in class.
You will have to adjust them to support more complex protocols, implement the TBGP, and finally, add support
for the Bluffer game in your server, and implement a client.
The rest of this document is organized as follows: section 2 presents the TBGP and its specifications, section 3
presents the Bluffer game and its implementation using TBGP, section 4 describes implementation details.

You can find the assignment instructions in the Server and Client folder.
